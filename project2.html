                                            This project was an international collaboration with students from the Netherlands, conducted entirely online. To facilitate seamless communication, we used Google Docs, Microsoft Teams, and KakaoTalk.

                                            Our goal was to tackle issues affecting young people today.
                                            <br><br>
                                            To understand these challenges, we explored several questions:
                                            <br><br>
                                            What concerns do <b>youth</b> in Korea and the Netherlands have?
                                            What's the biggest difference between these two places for the <b>youth</b>?
                                            What big changes or trends in the world are affecting the <b>youth</b>?
                                            <br><br>
                                            From our discussions, we found two keywords: "Money" and "Travel." These themes were both related and conflicting, as traveling often requires a budget.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Understanding the Dutch students' interest in visiting Korea, our project specifically targeted the aspect of "traveling to Korea."

                                                Initially, we sketched out the design on a whiteboard using markers. Thanks to the engineers' insights, we were able to thoughtfully consider how deeply users would interact with the features for an effective experience. Following that, I created the wireframe designs using Figma.

                                        The user selects a friend from their list, activating a split-view interface. The left side of the interface displays the user’s profile, which includes their current schedule and local time. The right side simultaneously displays the selected friend’s profile with their schedule adjusted to the user’s local time zone.

                                        The interface employs a color-coding system to differentiate between AM and PM times, with AM represented by a vibrant orange and PM by a serene blue. This color-coding extends throughout the UI for consistency and ease of understanding, featuring not only on the schedule detail pages but also on the friends list. The friends list provides an at-a-glance view of each friend’s local time with the corresponding AM/PM color cues, thereby improving the organization and quick comprehension of global time zones.
