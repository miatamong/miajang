                                            This project was an international collaboration with students from the Netherlands, conducted entirely online. To facilitate seamless communication, we used Google Docs, Microsoft Teams, and KakaoTalk.

                                            Our goal was to tackle issues affecting young people today.

                                            To understand these challenges, we explored several questions:
                                            <br><br>
                                            What concerns do <b>youth</b> in Korea and the Netherlands have?

                                            What's the biggest difference between these two places for the <b>youth</b>?
                                            <br>

                                            From our discussions, we found two keywords: "Money" and "Travel." These themes were both related and conflicting, as traveling often requires a budget.

                                            Understanding the Dutch students' interest in visiting Korea, our project specifically targeted the aspect of "traveling to Korea."

                                        Completing this project <b>entirely through online meetings</b> has taught me the importance of aligning every member’s understanding of the same project. Our team leveraged digital communication tools and entire weekly meetings for <b>seamless collaboration.</b>

                                        <b>Feedback from our team members in the Netherlands</b> was instrumental in recognizing the need for multi-currency support. As a result, we expanded our service to include various currencies like the won, dollar, and euro, significantly enhancing <b>accessibility for international users.</b>
