                                            After returning home from an exchange student in Hawaii, I quickly noticed a stark contrast in the depth of my conversations with a friend.
                                            <br>
                                            These are the superficial questions that we have been asking.

                                        "How's the weather there?"
                                        <br>
                                        "What time is it there?"
                                        <br>
                                        "What are you planning to do today?"

                                            These repetitive inquiries were rather a vivid reminder of the vast distance between us - physically and emotionally. Motivated to bridge this gap, I proposed the development of our application as a project in my Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course.
